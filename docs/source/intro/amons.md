# What are amons?


We describe details on generation of amons, which are to be used for training ML models.

For more details, see the paper [[1]](#1).

## covalent amons


The most fundamental amons are those covalently connected fragments of query mol.

## vdW amons


Non-covalent amons are typically made up of at least two covlent amons.

## static amons

This type of amons could be any of the above two kinds.
