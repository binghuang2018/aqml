# Introduction
Quantum machine learning (QML) has been manifested as a powerful alternative towards solving Schr\"odinger equation of molecular systems due to its potential accuracy as well as speed. These nice features come at a cost of training data, which plays a fundamental role in determining the final performance of a QML model.
