We describe details on generation of amons, which are to be used for training ML models.

### covalent amons
The most fundamental amons are those covalently connected fragments of query mol.

### vdW amons
Non-covalent amons are typically made up of at least two covlent amons.

### static amons
This type of amons could be any of the above two kinds.
