Two main tasks are covered:

- Amons generation
  - Covalent amons (see file `amons/amons-generation-covalent.ipynb`)
  - Non-covalent amons (see file `amons/generate_amons_vdw.ipynb`)

- Amons-based quantum machine learning (see file `aml/aml,ipynb`)
  - generation of (a)SLATM representation
  - KRR model based on SLATM + amons
