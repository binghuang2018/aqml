Amons-based quantum machine learning for chemistry problems

Features:
1) Parameter-free SLATM, aSLATM representations with improved efficiency for generation
2) BAML representation, including up to 4-body potential (force-field inspired)
3) KRR, multi-fidelity KRR
4) Automatic sampling of training set that are most representative for any query molecule (composition and size-independent. So far, limited to molecules without periodic boundary condition).
